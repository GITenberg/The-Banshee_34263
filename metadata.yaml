description: The banshee is a fearsome female creature that figures heavily in Irish
  mythology. Usually regarded as a harbinger of death and doom, the banshee is often
  depicted as wearing bloodstained clothing and unleashing an unearthly howl when
  someone is about to perish. This comprehensive study of banshee mythology from folklorist
  Elliott O'Donnell is one of the most extensive volumes ever published on the subject.
